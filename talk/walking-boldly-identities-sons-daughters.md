### <span class="talk-abstract">Abstract</span>

Adoption has become one of the prominent ways of “doing family” with growing numbers of orphans worldwide.  Findings show the importance of identity development as well as family cohesion in shaping a child’s mental health.  Results illuminate Paul’s discussion of the new identity found in our spiritual adoption as beloved sons and daughters of God the Father.  In this talk, I draw from research findings, the Bible, and personal testimony to show the significance of finding and walking in one’s true identity.  I furthermore highlight the importance of individuals who are willing to embody Jesus in His redemptive work of re-establishing identity and connecting spiritual orphans to their family.
