The silicon valley makes technology that’s used around the world, but is it safe? How can we love our neighbors and the least of these who find themselves in corrupt societies, or in an abusive situation? We’ll cover some existing ways tech companies are beginning to think about these problems, as well as current efforts and future ideas in the area of user security for vulnerable populations.
