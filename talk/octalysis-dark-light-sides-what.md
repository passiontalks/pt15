Session 2A, 1:40pm, Room 114

### <span class="talk-abstract">Abstract</span>

Have you ever wondered why it is so hard to motivate people (including yourself) to do things that are meaningful? Even when you figure out quick-burst ways to change behavior, motivation starts to dwindle again after a short period of time. It becomes discouraging, demoralizing, and eventually leads to burnout. Gamification Pioneer Yu-kai Chou combines years of research and experience in game design, game dynamics, motivational psychology, behavioral economics, and UX/UI to explain the mysterious dynamics between White Hat and Black Hat Motivation in his Octalysis Framework, and how we can design for better long-run motivation.
