[IVGrad @ Stanford](http://ivgrad.stanford.edu/) is proud
to present the fourth annual Passion Talks conference, to be held on
August 22, 2015 at Stanford University.

Passion Talks are short talks which integrate the scholarly work and
Christian faith of the speaker. The conference welcomes speakers in
all disciplines (both academic and professional) and at all stages of
their respective personal faith journeys. Talks vary in the degree to
which they focus on and combine elements from the speakers' work and
faith. Integration of work and faith is strongly encouraged in all
talks. Speakers are encouraged to review the
[vision statement for 2015]({{ site.baseurl }}/vision) and
[recorded talks from previous conferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/previous)
for inspiration and guidance in preparing their talks.

To promote humble dialogue and deeper relationships, this year's
conference will provide speakers the additional opportunity to
participate in panel discussions of the various issues in their
fields. All speakers are encouraged to participate.

# Submissions

We are now accepting submissions for Passion Talks 2015. **Submissions
close June 22, 2015 at 11:59pm PDT.** All submissions must include an
abstract, professional bio, and statement of faith. Accepted talks
will be included in the conference proceedings online and in
print. You may select to keep your personal information (name, etc.)
private. See the [Submissions]({{ site.baseurl }}/submit)
page for details and to submit your talk.

Talks will be reviewed as they are submitted, and all speakers will
receive a decision by Tuesday, July 7. *If you need to have a decision
by a certain date in order to arrange travel plans, please let us know
in the Additional Comments section of the submission form.*

## Practice Talks

We ask that all speakers join us for an informal practice talk session
before the conference. These sessions help improve your talk by
providing you an opportunity to give and receive feedback in an
informal setting. Practice talks will be held at both Stanford (August
12 and 14) and UC Berkeley (August 8), so speakers may attend
whichever is most convenient. Sessions will be at most 2 hours, not
including travel time to and from the session, with timeslots arranged
according to speaker availability and preference. The committee will
do its best to offer alternative accommodations if either location or
schedule is a problem. Practice talks will be arranged after all
decisions have been announced.

## Panel Discussions

Part of the conference will include panel discussions to promote
humble dialogue between speakers and attendees. Speakers will sit on a
panel with a couple other speakers, grouped by similar
topics. Participation in a panel is not required, but is
encouraged. Panels will be arranged after all decisions have been
announced.

## Talk Guidelines

  * Talks may be up to 15 minutes.

  * Each talk will be followed by up to 5 minutes of Q&A.

  * You may optionally use PowerPoint or other presentation
    software. Please bring your own laptop (with adapters).

  * In your talk, try to stay within your area of expertise and your
    own personal experiences.

  * However, citations of other peopleâ€™s work and experiences are also
    welcome (where appropriate).

  * We ask that all speakers be open and honest about their personal
    faith journey. While we do not require speakers to make a formal
    statement of faith during their talks, we believe talks are more
    effective when they integrate these elements explicitly.

  * In particular, we strongly encourage speakers to bring out how
    their faith and work directly or indirectly influence each other.

  * At the beginning of your talk, be sure to introduce who you are
    and where you are from.
